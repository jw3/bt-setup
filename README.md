program various bluetooth boards

### bluetooth hardware

#### HC-05

Set up as master, first connection to bt slave

```
AT+ORGL
AT+ROLE=1
AT+RESET
AT+INIT
AT+PSWD=1234 #optional
AT+RMAAD
AT+PAIR=[csv-device-id],[connect-ttl]
AT+BIND=[csv-device-id]
AT+LINK=[csv-device-id]
```

#### manual reconnect

After connected once, all that is needed is

```
AT+LINK=[csv-device-id]
```

Should look at putting the init into an exposed function call.

#### auto-connect

Using the connection mode command you can switch between manual and automatic connections.

 `AT+CMODE` will be `0` by default.  After successfully linking the devices change it to `1`.
 
Restart the device and it should pair with the previously paired device.

Device ids are generated from mac and some process i cant define at this point

`00:19:01:49:32:33` becomes `0019,01,493233`
